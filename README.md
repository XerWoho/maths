# Conversion from vertex form to standard form

Here you can practice how quick you can convert the vertex form to the standard form. 

When starting the game by entering:
+ .\pyrun (Windows)
+ ./pyrun.sh (Linux || macOS)

You will be prompted to enter in your username when the game starts. It is not currently really used in any way, other than the start. 

```
Enter in your username:
xerwoho_
```


Your username and streaks/history is all saved in the users.json file. Look inside!

#

You have 3 Options
+ Typing
+ Choosing
+ History

## Typing
When you choose typing, it is gonna be a little bit more difficult. You will need to write whole standard form on your own.
To square is always written as "^2".

## Choosing
When choosing it is easier, because you get 4 results, of which 3 are wrong. You're goal will be to decide which one is right, and
select + enter it. 

After each game you will get a time in seconds, telling you how long it took you to complete the translation or how long it took you to choose the right answer.

You can collect streaks and see how far you go! Note: The streaks are NOT being stored anywhere.

### Selecting
```
    Alright xerwoho
    Choose a game of your liking!
    >   Typing
        Choosing
        History
        Exit
```

Here is a quick preview on how it would look like if you would choose the option 'Typing'.

### Typing
```
    Whats this vertex form when changed in to the standard form ?
    1(x - (1))^2 - 1

    Enter!

    _
```

When Typing you can either give a wrong answer or a right answer. It will tell you that, show you how long it took, and then give you a step-by-step guide on how to solve it.

##### Wrong answer
```
    Wrong! Took you 0.94s
    Formula: -2(x - (-1))^2 - 3
    Steps:
    -2(x + 1)^2 - 3
    -2(x^2 + 2x + 1) - 3
    -2x^2 - 4x - 2 - 3
    -2x^2 - 4x - 5

    Streak before loss: 1
```

##### Right answer
```
    Youre right!
    Took you 16.18s
    Formula: -3(x - (-2))^2 - 2
    Steps:
    -3(x + 2)^2 - 2
    -3(x^2 + 4x + 4) - 2
    -3x^2 - 12x - 12 - 2
    -3x^2 - 12x - 14

    Current streak: 1
```

Here is a quick preview on how it would look like if you would choose the option 'Choosing'.

### Choosing
```
    What is the standard form from this vertex form?
    2(x - (3))^2 - 3

    >  2x^2 + 9x - 17
       2x^2 + 14x - 12
       2x^2 + 10x - 14
       2x^2 - 12x + 15
```

Just like typing, when choosing you can either give a wrong answer or a right answer. It will also tell you that, show you how long it took, and then give you a step-by-step guide on how to solve it.

You select by using the up and down arrow keys, and then choose the answer by hitting the enter key.


##### Wrong answer
```
    Wrong! Took you 0.59s
    Formula: -3(x - (-3))^2 - 3
    Steps:
    -3(x + 3)^2 - 3
    -3(x^2 + 6x + 9) - 3
    -3x^2 - 18x - 27 - 3
    -3x^2 - 18x - 30

    (Your answer: -3x^2 + 20x + 31)

    Streak before loss: 1
```

##### Right answer
```
    Youre right! Took you 0.33s
    Formula: -3(x - (2))^2 + 2
    Steps:
    -3(x - 2)^2 + 2
    -3(x^2 - 4x + 4) + 2
    -3x^2 + 12x - 12 + 2
    -3x^2 + 12x - 10

    Current streak: 1
```

You can use this to practice on how to translate the vertex form to the standard form or in general, just practice to get faster, or practice till you are able to do it in your head!

Should be your number one choice to practice and get the fastest time humanly possible.
